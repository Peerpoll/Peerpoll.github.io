<h4 id="nivolumab与docetaxel在晚期鳞状细胞非小细胞肺癌中治疗效果的比较">Nivolumab与Docetaxel在晚期鳞状细胞非小细胞肺癌中治疗效果的比较</h4>
<p>背景：</p>
<ol>
<li>Patients with advanced squamous-cell non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy have limited treatment options.</li>
<li>This randomized, open-label, international, phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint–inhibitor antibody, as compared with docetaxel in this patient population.
结论：
Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level.
简单来说：
The median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval, 7.3 to 13.3) with nivolumab versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.3) with docetaxel.
The risk of death was 41% lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.79; P&lt;0.001).
At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 42% (95% CI, 34 to 50) with nivolumab versus 24% (95% CI, 17 to 31) with docetaxel.
The response rate was 20% with nivolumab versus 9% with docetaxel (P = 0.008).
The median progression-free survival was 3.5 months with nivolumab versus 2.8 months with docetaxel (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001).
The expression of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit.
Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 7% of the patients in the nivolumab group as compared with 55% of those in the docetaxel group.
Nivolumab比Docetaxel的对肺癌的治疗效果要好，反应率，PFS, OS，风险比，安全性都要好，但是与PD-L1(免疫组化测定)表达无关</li>

<p>Between Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel.
In the total population, median overall survival was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12.7 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8.5 months with docetaxel.
Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4.0 months with docetaxel, with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0·88, 0·74–1·05; p=0·07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (HR 0·79, 95% CI 0·66–0·94; p=0·004).
Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median
14·9 months vs 8·2 months; HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·38–0·77; p=0·0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (17·3 months vs 8·2 months; 0·50, 0·36–0·70; p&lt;0·0001)
Likewise, for this patient population, progressionfree survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5·0 months vs 4·1 months; HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·44–0·78; p=0·0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (5·2 months vs 4·1 months; 0·59, 0·45–0·78; p&lt;0·0001).
Grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events were less common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13%] of 339 patients given 2 mg/kg, 55 [16%] of 343 given 10 mg/kg, and 109 [35%] of 309 given docetaxel)
总结：
在三种分组中，Pembrolizumab的两组OS结果比化疗组要好，但是PFS，三组没有显著差异；在PD-L1表达超过50%的分组中，OV和PFS结果显示，Pembrolizumab的两组结果比化疗组生存显著增长。相对于化疗组而言，Pembrolizumab组中的不良反应较少。
Pembrolizumab prolongs(延长) overall survival and has a favourable benefit-to-risk profile in patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.</p>

<p>1.In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 305 patients who had previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and no sensitizing mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene to receive either pembrolizumab (at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks) or the investigator’s choice of platinum-based chemotherapy.
2.In patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.</p>
<p>在PD-L1表达（免疫组化）表达&gt;50%且没有EGFR突变或ALK易位的患者中，Pembrolizumab组的PFS和OS显著比化疗组的长，治疗的不良事件少。
Median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval, 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P&lt;0.001).
The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P=0.005).
The response rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median duration of response was longer (not reached vs. 6.3 months), and treatment-related adverse events of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%).</p>

<p>背景：
Nivolumab has been associated with longer overall survival than docetaxel among patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
we compared first-line nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-Ll)-positive NSCLC.
结论：</p>
<ol>
<li>Among the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemo-therapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.45; P=0.25), and the median overall survival was 14.4 months versus 13.2 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30)</li>
<li>Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 71% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 92% of those who received chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 51% of those who received chemotherapy.
简单说就是：各种PDL1表达（免疫组化鉴定）&gt;5%的患者分组后，发现Nivolumab组相对与化疗组并没有显著的增长PFS和OS。相对化疗组而言，Nivolumab的安全性会好一点。
针对于PDL1&gt;50%的分组而言，生存，反应率之间也没有显著的差异
高突变组之间，Nivolumab相对于化疗组效果好，反应率高，PFS时间长，OS没有显著差异（可能是因为高TMB化疗组的后期大部分接受了Nivolumab治疗）
突变负荷和PDL1表达之间没有相关性
In conclusion, nivolumab monotherapy did not result in longer progression-free survival than platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for stage IV or recurrent NSCLC in a broad population of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more.
Overall survival with single-agent nivolumab was similar to overall survival with platinum doublet chemotherapy. Nivolumab had a favorable safety profile as compared with chemotherapy, and no new safety signals were observed.</li>

<p>Pembrolizumab improves or maintains health-related QOL (Quality of Life) compared with that for chemotherapy, and might represent a new frst-line standard of care for PD-L1-expressing, advanced NSCLC.
The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1 per blinded independent central review), was signifcantly longer with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy.</p>

<h4 id="在高tmb的肺癌患者中nivolumab加ipilimumab的治疗效果">在高TMB的肺癌患者中Nivolumab加Ipilimumab的治疗效果</h4>
<p>Progression-free survival among patients with a high tumor mutational burden was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy.
The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 42.6% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2% with chemotherapy, and the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P&lt;0.001).
The objective response rate was 45.3% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 26.9% with chemotherapy.
The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 31.2% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1% with chemotherapy.
简单说明：
高TMB中的 Nivolumab 加 Ipilimumab组的PFS更长，一年后的生存率也比化疗组的要高，反应率也高很多，治疗相关的不良反应比化疗要少，但是比单纯的Nivolumab治疗要多。
Progression-free survival was significantly longer with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with NSCLC and a high tumor mutational burden, irrespective of PD-L1 expression level.
The results validate the benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in NSCLC and the role of tumor mutational burden as a biomarker for patient selection.</p>

<p>Median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI, 18.3 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.8 to 19.0 months) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.86).
Treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events were less frequent with pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (31.2% v 53.3%, respectively).
With prolonged follow-up, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy continues to demonstrate an OS benefit over chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated, advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK aberrations, despite crossover from the control arm to pembrolizumab as subsequent therapy.
